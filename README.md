## About

NutriSnap is a web application that uses machine learning to identify food items and provide detailed nutritional information. By simply taking a picture of a food item, the app can provide a detailed breakdown of its nutritional content. This makes it easy for users to track their dietary intake and make informed decisions about their food choices.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Users can easily take a photo of their food, and the app will quickly provide the nutritional information. Users can also save their food items to a diary, which can be used to track their eating habits over time. The app also provides a visualized analysis of users' eating habits, helping them understand their dietary patterns and make necessary adjustments🔍
